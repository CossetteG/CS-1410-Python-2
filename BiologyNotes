Lecture 1: The scope of Biology
-Biology is the scientific study of life
    Life is structured on a siza scale ranging from molecular to global
    Diversity of all life on Earth
    Ecosystem>Community>Population>Organism>Organ System> Organ>Tissue>Cell>Molecule>Atom
-we are in the golden age of Biology
    biology is woven into the fabric of society
    research and medicine
-Cells and their DNA
    Cell is the lowest structure that can perform all activites required for life
    2 types:
    prokaryotic-no nucleus, smaller, no organelles
    eukaryotic-nucleus, larger, organelles
-all cells use Dna, all cells have Dna 
    dna transmits informationof how to build specific things
    4 nucleotides: A, C, G, T 
-DNA technology-genetic engineering and biotechnology have allowed us to manipulate DNA
-Ecosystems
    each organism iteracts with its environment
    cycel of nutrients/flow of energy
-diveristy is the hallmark of life  
    known species: 1.8 million
    estimated total number of species: 5-30 million
    99% of species in world history are extinct
-3domains of Life"
    Bacteria (prokaryotic)
    Archea(prokaryotic)
    Eukarya (eukaryotic)
        Protista
        Plantae
        Fungi
        Animalia
-life is united
    universal genetic language of DNA
    Universal architecture of eukaryotic cilia
    "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"-Dobzhansky
-Evolution and Charles Darwin
    evolution is one of biology's longest, best kept/proven theories of biology
    unifying theme of biology


Lecture 2: Science is a body of knowledge
    Many facts about science have been discovered
    we build on the knowledge of others "stand on the shoulders of giants"
-Scientific Hypothesis
    an educated guess about a process that is consistent with current scientific knowledge
    must be testable- can be proven FALSE (falsifiable)
-Scientific Fact 
    an observation that can be repeatedly confirmed
    can change/be varied/be improved
    better technology > better ways to see 
-Scientific Theory
    crown of science
    nobody argues with this shit
    less succeptable to change than fact
    an idea that is very supported by large amount of evidents from many different places
    the end point of science
        Big Bang Theory
        Evolutionary Theory
        Gravitational Theory
-Science is a way of knowing
    will only reference the natural world, never the supernatural
    testable against the empirical world. 
    falsifiable. there could always be new data that changes the truth
-Snek
    the eastern coral snake: poisonous
    scarlet king snake: non poisonous
    both bright :P 
-Knowledge Claim to Scientific Consensus
    after a study has been made it is subjected to critique
    PEER REVIEW- the process of verifiing a claim, repeating the experiment, etc 
    knowledge of authority or opinion throw it out
    weed out the bad ideas
-Science is not a democreacy 
    the only authority is the natural world- no revelation
    no unexplained exeptions allowed
    no value judgements- only true or false 
    no faith, no accepted tradition
-Ways of knowing:(not for science, but for real life)
    Authority religious, political, parental
    Democracy ) majority rules
    Consensus ) everyone agrees
    History () relies on the historical method
    Revelation/Inspiration 
    Moral
    Ethical- philosophy and religion
    -science doesn't hold all the knowledge
    -can coexist or can not coexist with science 
-Science can do Questions and Answers about empirical world
    Cannot: assign meaning, make decisions about morality
            explain god, tell you what to do with your life


What is Life?
-in class assignment
-what biologists consider alive:
    Organization 
    Cellular Composition - does it have a cell 
    Metabolism -chemical reactions
    Responsiveness and movement
    Development -growth or differentiation 
    Reproduction
    Evolution

Chemistry!
-Periodic table of elements
    atomic number - element symbol - mass number 
-*stardust to you*
-25 elements are essential to life
    4 are important:
        Oxygen
        Carbon
        Nitrogen
        Hydrogen
-Elements can combine to form compounds
    substances that contain two or more elements in a fixed revelation
    i.e. NaCl - salt 
-Atoms
    each element consists of one kind of atom 
    an atom is the smalles unit of matter that still retains the porperties of an element
    protons and neutrons - cloud of electrons
    atomic number: number of protons 
Isotopes- when you have the same element with different number of neutrons 
    carbon 13 has 6 proton and 7 neutrons (and 6 electrons)
    Radioactive Isotopes - more neutrons more unstable
        excreted energy can break chemical bonds and cause molecular damage in cells
        radioisotopes decay at a fixed rate, so isotope analysis can be used to date rocks and fossils
        can be used with PET Scan to diagnose disease
-Electrons 
    electron shells 2 8 8 etc 
    they like to fill their outermost (valence) shell 
    Ionic Bonds- NaCl stealing an electron to fill shells 
        the positive ion and negative ion attract
    Covalent Bond- H2 sharing an electron to fill the shell 
        typically covalent bonds are non-polar
        sometimes(water) electrons spend more time around one atom than the other- polar covalent 
-Chemical Reactions 
    breaking existing chemical bonds and forming new ones 
    can be symbolized with equations 
        2H2 + O2 = 2 H2O
-Water 
    water has two polar covalent bonds 
    polarity of water results in weak electrical attractions between neighboring water molecules
    called hydrogen bonds 
-waters life supporting properties
    cohesiveness
    moderate temperature
    floating ice 
    solvent versatility
-Water Cohesion 
    water molecules stick together as a result of hydrogen bonding
    cohesion is vital for water transport in plants
-Surface Tension
    H.B give water a high surface Tension
    the measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface fo a liquid
    insects that walk on water
-water can moderate temperatures 
    water absorbs a lot of evergy/heat before getting hotter or doing anything
    earths giant water supply causes temperatres to stay within limits that permit life
    evaporative cooling removes heat from the earth and from organisms 
-density of water > density of ice
    opposite of everything else 
    ice floats
    hydrogen bonds keep other molecules at a safe distance and it crystallizes like that
    ice needs to float over large bodies of water to keep some ecosystems alive
-Solvent 
    a solution is a liquid consisting of two or more substances (saltwater)
    solvent- the base substances (water)
    solute- what you add into the base substance (salt)
    water is great at this because it has random positve and negative charges
-PH scale Power Hydrogen-Ion 0-14
    Acid- chemical that yeets hydrogen ions (H+) to solutions
    Base- compount that yoinks hydrogen ions (H+) to solutions 
    water is completely neutral, has a PH of 7 


Molecules of Life
    biochemistry 
-Carbon Chemistry 
    carbon is a versatile atom 
        it has 4 electrons in an outer shell that holds 8 
        carbon can share its elections with other atoms to form up to four covalent bonds
    carbon can use its bonds to attach to other carbons or form an endless diversity of carbon skeletons 
-the simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons 
    these are organic moli=ecules containing only carbon and hydrogen, ie CH4 
-the unique properties of an aorganic compound depend not only on its carbons skeletion but also on the atoms attached to the skeletons
    these atoms are called functional groups, small groupings of atoms that determine the properties and characteristics of the compound     
-Most macromelicules are polymers 
    polymers are maade by stringing together many smaller molecules called monomers
    cells lind monomers by a process called dehydration synthesis 
-Organisms also have to break down macromolecules 
    cells do this by a process called hydrolysis
-Carbohydrates aka saccharides 
    small sugar molecules ie glucose and fructose (fruit n sugar ) C6H12O6 
    Long starch molecules ie starch (pasta n potatoes)
    glycogen and and cellulose 
-Disaccharides are joinged by the process of dehydration synthesis 
-Macromolecule | Monomer        | Polymer 
  carbohydrates| monosaccharide | polysaccharide 
-Lipids-fats 
    glycerol backbone binds with a fatty acit (carbon chain)
    saturated fats means every available spot is filled with hydrogen atoms
    unsaturated has a double bond somewhere that creates a kink and makes space between the molecules
