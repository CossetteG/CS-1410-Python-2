Lecture 1: The scope of Biology
-Biology is the scientific study of life
    Life is structured on a siza scale ranging from molecular to global
    Diversity of all life on Earth
    Ecosystem>Community>Population>Organism>Organ System> Organ>Tissue>Cell>Molecule>Atom
-we are in the golden age of Biology
    biology is woven into the fabric of society
    research and medicine
-Cells and their DNA
    Cell is the lowest structure that can perform all activites required for life
    2 types:
    prokaryotic-no nucleus, smaller, no organelles
    eukaryotic-nucleus, larger, organelles
-all cells use Dna, all cells have Dna 
    dna transmits informationof how to build specific things
    4 nucleotides: A, C, G, T 
-DNA technology-genetic engineering and biotechnology have allowed us to manipulate DNA
-Ecosystems
    each organism iteracts with its environment
    cycel of nutrients/flow of energy
-diveristy is the hallmark of life  
    known species: 1.8 million
    estimated total number of species: 5-30 million
    99% of species in world history are extinct
-3domains of Life"
    Bacteria (prokaryotic)
    Archea(prokaryotic)
    Eukarya (eukaryotic)
        Protista
        Plantae
        Fungi
        Animalia
-life is united
    universal genetic language of DNA
    Universal architecture of eukaryotic cilia
    "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"-Dobzhansky
-Evolution and Charles Darwin
    evolution is one of biology's longest, best kept/proven theories of biology
    unifying theme of biology


Lecture 2: Science is a body of knowledge
    Many facts about science have been discovered
    we build on the knowledge of others "stand on the shoulders of giants"
-Scientific Hypothesis
    an educated guess about a process that is consistent with current scientific knowledge
    must be testable- can be proven FALSE (falsifiable)
-Scientific Fact 
    an observation that can be repeatedly confirmed
    can change/be varied/be improved
    better technology > better ways to see 
-Scientific Theory
    crown of science
    nobody argues with this shit
    less succeptable to change than fact
    an idea that is very supported by large amount of evidents from many different places
    the end point of science
        Big Bang Theory
        Evolutionary Theory
        Gravitational Theory
-Science is a way of knowing
    will only reference the natural world, never the supernatural
    testable against the empirical world. 
    falsifiable. there could always be new data that changes the truth
-Snek
    the eastern coral snake: poisonous
    scarlet king snake: non poisonous
    both bright :P 
-Knowledge Claim to Scientific Consensus
    after a study has been made it is subjected to critique
    PEER REVIEW- the process of verifiing a claim, repeating the experiment, etc 
    knowledge of authority or opinion throw it out
    weed out the bad ideas
-Science is not a democreacy 
    the only authority is the natural world- no revelation
    no unexplained exeptions allowed
    no value judgements- only true or false 
    no faith, no accepted tradition
-Ways of knowing:(not for science, but for real life)
    Authority religious, political, parental
    Democracy ) majority rules
    Consensus ) everyone agrees
    History () relies on the historical method
    Revelation/Inspiration 
    Moral
    Ethical- philosophy and religion
    -science doesn't hold all the knowledge
    -can coexist or can not coexist with science 
-Science can do Questions and Answers about empirical world
    Cannot: assign meaning, make decisions about morality
            explain god, tell you what to do with your life


What is Life?
-in class assignment
-what biologists consider alive:
    Organization 
    Cellular Composition - does it have a cell 
    Metabolism -chemical reactions
    Responsiveness and movement
    Development -growth or differentiation 
    Reproduction
    Evolution

Chemistry!
-Periodic table of elements
    atomic number - element symbol - mass number 
-*stardust to you*
-25 elements are essential to life
    4 are important:
        Oxygen
        Carbon
        Nitrogen
        Hydrogen
-Elements can combine to form compounds
    substances that contain two or more elements in a fixed revelation
    i.e. NaCl - salt 
-Atoms
    each element consists of one kind of atom 
    an atom is the smalles unit of matter that still retains the porperties of an element
    protons and neutrons - cloud of electrons
    atomic number: number of protons 
Isotopes- when you have the same element with different number of neutrons 
    carbon 13 has 6 proton and 7 neutrons (and 6 electrons)
    Radioactive Isotopes - more neutrons more unstable
        excreted energy can break chemical bonds and cause molecular damage in cells
        radioisotopes decay at a fixed rate, so isotope analysis can be used to date rocks and fossils
        can be used with PET Scan to diagnose disease
-Electrons 
    electron shells 2 8 8 etc 
    they like to fill their outermost (valence) shell 
    Ionic Bonds- NaCl stealing an electron to fill shells 
        the positive ion and negative ion attract
    Covalent Bond- H2 sharing an electron to fill the shell 
        typically covalent bonds are non-polar
        sometimes(water) electrons spend more time around one atom than the other- polar covalent 
-Chemical Reactions 
    breaking existing chemical bonds and forming new ones 
    can be symbolized with equations 
        2H2 + O2 = 2 H2O
-Water 
    water has two polar covalent bonds 
    polarity of water results in weak electrical attractions between neighboring water molecules
    called hydrogen bonds 
-waters life supporting properties
    cohesiveness
    moderate temperature
    floating ice 
    solvent versatility
-Water Cohesion 
    water molecules stick together as a result of hydrogen bonding
    cohesion is vital for water transport in plants
-Surface Tension
    H.B give water a high surface Tension
    the measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface fo a liquid
    insects that walk on water
-water can moderate temperatures 
    water absorbs a lot of evergy/heat before getting hotter or doing anything
    earths giant water supply causes temperatres to stay within limits that permit life
    evaporative cooling removes heat from the earth and from organisms 
-density of water > density of ice
    opposite of everything else 
    ice floats
    hydrogen bonds keep other molecules at a safe distance and it crystallizes like that
    ice needs to float over large bodies of water to keep some ecosystems alive
-Solvent 
    a solution is a liquid consisting of two or more substances (saltwater)
    solvent- the base substances (water)
    solute- what you add into the base substance (salt)
    water is great at this because it has random positve and negative charges
-PH scale Power Hydrogen-Ion 0-14
    Acid- chemical that yeets hydrogen ions (H+) to solutions
    Base- compount that yoinks hydrogen ions (H+) to solutions 
    water is completely neutral, has a PH of 7 


Molecules of Life
    biochemistry 
-Carbon Chemistry 
    carbon is a versatile atom 
        it has 4 electrons in an outer shell that holds 8 
        carbon can share its elections with other atoms to form up to four covalent bonds
    carbon can use its bonds to attach to other carbons or form an endless diversity of carbon skeletons 
-the simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons 
    these are organic moli=ecules containing only carbon and hydrogen, ie CH4 
-the unique properties of an aorganic compound depend not only on its carbons skeletion but also on the atoms attached to the skeletons
    these atoms are called functional groups, small groupings of atoms that determine the properties and characteristics of the compound     
-Most macromelicules are polymers 
    polymers are maade by stringing together many smaller molecules called monomers
    cells lind monomers by a process called dehydration synthesis 
-Organisms also have to break down macromolecules 
    cells do this by a process called hydrolysis
-Carbohydrates aka saccharides 
    small sugar molecules ie glucose and fructose (fruit n sugar ) C6H12O6 
    Long starch molecules ie starch (pasta n potatoes)
    glycogen and and cellulose 
-Disaccharides are joinged by the process of dehydration synthesis 
-Macromolecule | Monomer        | Polymer 
  carbohydrates| monosaccharide | polysaccharide 
-Lipids-fats 
    glycerol backbone binds with a fatty acit (carbon chain)
    saturated fats means every available spot is filled with hydrogen atoms
    unsaturated has a double bond somewhere that creates a kink and makes space between the molecules

Cells
-Cells are the building blocks of all life 
-Cells must be tiny for materials to move in and out of them fast enough to meet the cell's meabolic needs 
    its better for us to have a lot of little cells than one big cell for 2 reasons:
    -it would take too long for things to travel within the cell (energy, nutrients, waste)
-The accumulation of scietific evidence leads to the cell theory 
-most cells are microscopic
-prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in several respects
    eukaryotic have nucleus and organelles and are bigger
-Prokaryotic Cell- lots on the outside
    Pili, capsule, Cell wall, Plasma membrane, Ribosomes, Nucleoid region(DNA), and Prokaryotic flagella
-Eukaryotic Cells- lots on the inside 
    Centrioles, Lysosome, Flagellum (animal cells) 
    Mitochondrion, Plasma Membrane, Cytoskeleton, Ribosomes, Nucleus, Smooth ER, Rough ER, Golgi apparatus, 
    Central Vacuole, Cell Wall, Chloroplast
-Cell Membrane- made of phospholipids (phosphate group + fatty acid tails) 
    half hydrophilic/half hydrophobic 
    the cells arrange themselves to keep the water out in two rows called 
    a phospholipid bi-layer 
    there's also proteins sprinkled in the layer 
    its all very fluid and mobile
    Some functions of membrane proteins
        attachment to sytoskeleton and extra stuff
        cell signaling 
        recognition
        joining together
-Nucleus
    has its own cell membrane 
    contains chromatin- a complex of DNA and proteins
    Nucleolis- produces the Ribosomes
    rough endoplasmic ret
    How DNA Controls the Cell:
        DNA controls the cell by transferring its coded information into RNA 
        information in the RNA is used to make proteins aka mRNA 
-Endoplasmic Reticulum (rough and smooth)
    rough has ribosomes, smooth does not
    produces and enormous varaety of molecules 
    smooth ER produces lipis and steroids/enzymes and they detox
    rough ER is mainly about making proteins 
    Ribosomes make primary stage protein, rough ER folds it into its shape and packs it into a transport vessel
    where it goes to 
-The Golgi apparatus refines, stores and distributes the products of cells
    perfects the proteins and packages it for shipment out of the cell
    there it can be pooped out of the cell 
    Ribosomes can be in the golgi workflow or out of it. 
    outside is for in the cell, inside is for out of the cell 
-Vacuoles 
    plants and some eukaryote Protists
    contractile in protist to keep water out
    in plants it's there to store water 
-Mitochondria !!!!!!!!!!!!
    has 2 membranes, the inner memberane are called cristae where atp is created
    are the sites of cellular respiration, which involves the production of atp from food 
    Endosymbiotic Hypothesis - the idea that small cells used to live inside a bigger cell in a symbiotic relationship
        mitochondria has its own DNA like prokaryotes 
        has circular dna like prokaryotic cells 
        they also have their own ribosomes like prokaryotes
        undergo fission
-Chloroplasts 
    the sites of photosynthesis
-Cytoskeleton 
    system of proteins that scaffold the cell and provide 
     transport paths and shape/support for the cell
    Microtubules (constantly assembling and disassembling)-the big tubes
    help with mitosis 
    can also change the cell shape, and in somecases helps it move, called amoeboid movement 
-Cilia and Flagella 
    motile appendages 
    flagella propel the cell in a whiplike motion 
    the only human cell with flagellum is sperm 
    cilia is shorter and there are more of them (cell hair)
    cilia move in a coordinated back n forth motion 
    can be found in the inner lining of lots of things, including female reproductive and respitory tract
-Plant Cell Walls and Cell Junctions 
    plant cells are encsed by cell walls which provide support for the cells
    the cells have channels between them called plasmodesmata
-animal cell junctions 
    lots of types ie tight juctions, anchoring junctions, and communicating junctions
    tight junctions sew cells together and keep stuff from getting through ie stomach lining
    anchoring keep muscles from tearing apart ie in the heart
    communicating junctions allow stuff to pass from one cell to another
-Cell Membrane Transport 
    cell membranes are semi-permeable 
    only some things are allowed through the cell membrane 
    passive transport -does not require atp
        diffusion - movement of molecules from a high concentration to a low concentration 
          (solute > solution) concentration gradient. going down the gradient requires no energy
          non-polar, lipid, gases, non-polar substances will be able to pass through the fatty acid layer just fine
        facilitated diffusion - still diffusion, but the molecule needs to go through a protein channel becuase it can't cross by itself
          polar/hydrophilic stuff will have trouble going through and need to be facilitated
        osmosis - diffusion of Hypertonic(more solute) and Hypotonic(less solution)
          water moves towards the side with more solute to try to balance the ratio of solution to water 
    active transport - moving a solute against its natural inclinations 
        reverse osmosis- moving up/against their concentration gradient
        requires energy/atp 
    
Metabolism, Photosynthesis, and Cellular Respiration 
-metabolism is the total cost of all energy required to do everything 
-every reaction requires activation energy 
    our bodies use enzymes (a class of proteins) to lower the activation energy required for a reaction 
    important to make sure we don't use too much heat and denature all our proteins 
-Photosynthesis is for plants 
    plants use sunlight and carbon dioxide and water to make glucose and O2 
    6 CO2 + 6 H2O >> C6H12O6 + 6 O2
    light enters and start light reactions in the thylakoids H2O >> Oxygen 
    from light reactions come nadph which goes into the calvin cycle along with CO2 and a little atp
        and the output is sugar and nadp+ and adp 
-Cellular Respiration is mostly for animals
    mitochondria take glucose and oxygen and creates atp and heat and water and carbon dioxide 
    C6H12O6 + 6 O2 >> 6 CO2 + 6 H20 + ATP
    glycolosis > citric acid cycle > electron transport 
          NADH are electron carriers
        glycolosis is outside the mitochondria - 
          splitting the glycose into 2 smaller molecules called pyruvic acid (2 ATP + 2 NADH)
    ~enter mitochondria
    Acedtyl CoA- (2 CO2 + 2 NADH)
    Citric Acid Cycle- (2 ATP and 4 CO2 + 6 NADH)
    Electron Transport chain- all the NADH molecules drop off their electrons to this protein chain
        they hot potato it for a while which creates most of our energy 
        (about 34 ATP + H2O) 
    total we usually get 38 ATP total from the process per molecule of glucose 
Cellular Division- Mitosis 
-karyotype chromosomes are all of the dna of the genome 
    we have the nuclear genome and the mitochdrial genomes 
    we have 23 pairs of chromosomes -one from the father and one from the mother
    each pair has different versions of the same genes 
    homologus chromosomes refer to the chromosomes that are paired 
    a variant of the same information is called an allele. there are dominant and submissive allele 
    pairs 1-22 are the autosomes, the last pair is the sex chromosomes x or y 
    y is shorter, xx is female, xy is male 
    dna is always wrapped around proteins called histones
    when dna is coiled tightly enough to be able to see under a microscope right before mitosis,
      thats what we call the chromosomes 
-the cell cycle 
    interphase is the cell most of the time 90% 
        G1- normal cell activites -growth phase
        S phase- the dna in the nucleus is duplicated -DNA synthesis
            when the chromosomes are getting duplicated, at first they are copied but still attached, called sister chromatids
        G2- growth phase 2- organelles are starting to divide and we're getting ready for cell division 
    Mitotic Phase 10% when its goin through mitosis
        (the duplicated chromosome is then split during mitosis)
        Centrioles are a system or short microtubials 
        Prophase -
            chromosomes condense enough to be seen under a microscope 
            centrioles start growing mitotic spindles
            nuclear envelope /nuclear membrane breaks down and the mitotic spindles attach to the chromosomes 
        Metaphase - 
            lining up the chromosomes in a line
        Anaphase - 
            mitotic spindles shrink, pulling the chromosomes apart 
        Telophase - 
            anti Prophase
            nuclear envelope reforms
            chromosome unwinds 
        Cytokinesis - 
            pinches the parent cell called the cleavage furrow 
            it deepens until it breaks into two daughter cells 
        plants go through basically the same process except they have the cell wall so 
          instead of cytokineses it grows a cell plate that grows into a cell wall
